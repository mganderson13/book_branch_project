        <h1>About the Book Branch</h1>
        <p>Book Branch is a project inspired by my book loving friends. 
        It utilizes the Google Books API to display book information and links to PDF versions of books. 
        Book Branch was created with a React front end and Node back end. To save user data Book Branch uses a MongoDB database and is hosted using Google's Firebase hosting services.</p>
        <p>Users can browse or search for books, create an account to save their books and add reviews to titles they have read.</p>
